# Alphabetizer

Simple webapp to alphabetize lists. Live demo at https://hanki.dev/alpha

Project goal was to learn [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## npm

Build css with `npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o src/compiled.css`

`src/compiled.css` should not be in repository but is there in order for GitHub Pages to work.

## ideas

- If only 1 line, break commas automatically (otherwise not)
- Figure out how to make GitHub Pages work without pushing `src/compiled.css`
